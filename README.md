# üì± Install Our Android App on Android Go

This app is designed specifically for dumbphones. While it can be ran on Android smartphones, usability may be hindered greatly

Here's a breakdown on how to install our app:

---

## What You‚Äôll Need

- An Android flip phone that runs on **Android 10**, SDK v. 29 or newer
- A computer
- Either a USB connector or access to a cloud service on the flip phone (Google Drive, OneDrive, etc)

---

## Step 1: Download the App File (APK)

1. Click the link below to download the app file:

   üëâ **[Download the APK](./does-not-exist.apk)**  

---

## Step 2: Allow App Installs from Unknown Sources

A lot of flip phones either block third-party downloads that aren't on the Google Play store, or layer proprietary filters to limit user access (lame!)

If you have access to the Google Play store:
1. Tap the downloaded file (it may be called something like `app-release.apk`).
2. You‚Äôll see a message:  
   _‚ÄúFor your security, your phone is not allowed to install unknown apps from this source.‚Äù_
3. Tap **Settings** on that message.
4. Enable **Allow from this source** by tapping the switch.
5. Press **Back**, then tap **Install**.

If there are issues from limited access, consider either using a different model ( like {enter models here} ) or follow a web tutorial for rooting your flip phone

## Step 3: Finish Installation & Open the App

- After it installs, tap **Open**.
- The app will launch and you're ready to use it! üéâ

---

## Finding the Downloaded File (If Needed)

If you don‚Äôt see the install prompt:

1. Open the **Files** or **File Manager** app (comes pre-installed).
2. Go to the **Downloads** folder.
3. Tap the `.apk` file to install.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **"App not installed" error?**
  - Make sure there's enough free space. These devices often have less than 2GB of RAM, which could limit your ability to root or download.
  - Restart your phone and try again.

## How to update to the most current version?

Just repeat these steps with the latest `.apk` file. No need to delete the old app ‚Äî Android will replace it automatically.
